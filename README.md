## Project Synposis - ZapSure

An insurance agent in your pocket which will make insurance claims as easy as clicking a selfie, now you dont need to wait couple of weeks for getting your health/car insurance, this app will assess the damage of your car based on a photo clicked by you and then by using multiple CNN models we will predict the amount to be claimed by the user, in this app we took a model which checks for the car in the image, check for damage, check for area of damage, check for severity of the damage.
The project was trained on an ec2 server on AWS with about a dataset of 2500 images of different angles and severity.

Model on 2 different scenarios:

**1-Perfect Car**
